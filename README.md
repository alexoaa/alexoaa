- 👋 Hi Alejandro Olvera and am from Mexico.🇲🇽
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, on the front and back end, so I can create complete web applications. 
- 🌱 I normally work with Vuejs on the front and I use Nodejs with express on the back.
- ⚒️ Other technologies I use are SASS, Tailwind CSS, NPM, git for control versiona and MySQL for databases.  

- 📫 Here's my portfolio so you can know more about me, my work and experience. https://alexoa.dev
